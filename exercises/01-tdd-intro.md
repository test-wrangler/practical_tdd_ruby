# Overview

In this exercise, we'll get our feet wet with TDD and the red, green, refactor loop.

# Exercise

To do this, build a new Taco class that tells us it's name. You'll want to create the spec in the `spec/models` directory and the model in the `app/models` directory. As you're doing this, be sure to use the tests to drive out the functionality. This means that you should start with your tests, and then only implement enough code to fix the error that you're seeing in your test. The functionality here is purposefully very simple to allow you to get familiar with TDD. We just want a class that basically has a name property with a getter and setter.
